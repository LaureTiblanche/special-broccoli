Deflecting Wave;reaction;1;Impulse, Kineticist, Primal, Water;;;;;;;;You would take acid, bludgeoning, fire, or slashing damage from an enemy's attack, spell, or other hostile effect. ;;You're aware of the hostile effect, and you aren't off-guard against it.;;A cascade of water blunts or disperses the incoming attack. You gain resistance to damage from the triggering effect equal to your level if it's bludgeoning or slashing, or double your level if it's acid or fire damage. If the effect deals more than one applicable type of damage, apply the highest resistance, but apply it only once.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;DarkSlateBlue;portal
Hail of Splinters;2;1;Impulse, Kineticist, Overflow, Primal, Wood;;;;;;;;;;;;A fusillade of jagged splinters flies from you. Creatures in a 30-foot cone take 1d4 piercing damage and 1d4 persistent bleed damage with a basic Reflex save against your class DC.;;;;;;;;Each type of damage increases by 1d4.;;;;;;DarkSlateGray;portal
Hardwood Armor;1;1;Impulse, Kineticist, Primal, Wood;;;;;;;;;;;;"Wood and bark grow over your body like armor. This hardwood armor is medium armor but uses your highest armor proficiency. The wooden armor's statistics are: AC Bonus +3; Dex Cap +2; Check Penalty –2; Speed Penalty –5 feet; Strength +2; Bulk 1; Group wood. Any bonuses, runes, and magical abilities of your actual armor are suppressed, but any runes that could apply to the hardwood armor are replicated onto it.<br>When you use this impulse, you can also create a wooden shield in a free hand. You can Shield Block with this shield even if you don't have that feat. The hand wielding this shield counts as a free hand for using impulses. The shield decays in an instant if it becomes broken or leaves your grasp.<br>The armor lasts for 10 minutes, and you can Dismiss this impulse. If you use this impulse again, any existing one ends.";;;;;;;;;The shield's Hardness increases by 1, its HP by 4, and its BT by 2.;;;;;DarkSlateGray;portal
Versatile Blasts;;;Kineticist;;;;;;;;;;;;Accessing a wider realm of elemental manifestations, you can make blasts with rare forms of your elements. Add the following damage types to those you can choose for Elemental Blasts of that element: air cold, earth poison, fire cold, metal electricity, water acid, wood poison.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;dimgray;portal
Channel Elements;1;;Aura, Kineticist, Primal;;;;;;;;;;Your kinetic gate isn't active.;;You tap into your kinetic gate to make elements flow around you. Your kinetic aura activates, and as a part of this action, you can use a 1-action Elemental Blast or a 1-action stance impulse. Your kinetic aura is a 10-foot emanation where pieces of your kinetic element (or all your kinetic elements, if you can channel more than one) flow around you. The kinetic aura can't damage anything or affect the environment around you unless another ability allows it to. Channel Elements has the traits of all your kinetic elements.<br>Your kinetic aura automatically deactivates if you're knocked out, you use an impulse with the overflow trait, or you Dismiss the aura. Though you can't use new impulses while your kinetic aura is deactivated, ones you already used remain, and you can still Sustain any that can be sustained. Stance impulses are linked to your kinetic aura and end when the aura deactivates.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;dimgray;portal
Elemental Blast;1,2;;Attack, Impulse, Kineticist, Primal;;;;;;;;;;;;With a wave of your hand, you collect elemental matter from your aura and swing or hurl it. Choose one of your kinetic elements and a damage type listed for that element, then make a melee or ranged impulse attack against the AC of one creature. Add your Strength modifier to the damage roll for a melee Elemental Blast. If you make a 2-action Elemental Blast, you gain a status bonus to the damage roll equal to your Constitution modifier.<br>The element determines the damage die, damage type, and range (for a ranged blast). A damage type other than a physical damage type adds its trait to the blast.<br>- Air 1d6 electricity or slashing, 60 feet<br>- Earth 1d8 bludgeoning or piercing, 30 feet<br>- Fire 1d6 fire, 60 feet<br>- Metal 1d8 piercing or slashing, 30 feet<br>- Water 1d8 bludgeoning or cold, 30 feet<br>- Wood 1d8 bludgeoning or vitality, 30 feet;;;;The target takes double damage.;The target takes full damage.;;;;;The damage increases by one die.;;;;dimgray;portal
Base Kinesis;2;;Impulse, Kineticist, Primal;;;;;;;;;;;;It's trivial for you to create some of your element or alter a portion of it that already exists. Choose one of your kinetic elements to affect. This impulse has a range of 30 feet, and the Bulk of the target must be negligible or light. The GM decides what Bulk the element is. You can't affect an element that's magical, secured in place (like a stone mortared in a wall), or attended by a creature unwilling to let you.<br>Choose one of the following options, though the GM might allow you to make similar small alterations. Base Kinesis can't deal damage or cause conditions unless otherwise noted.<br>- Generate : You bring an ordinary, non-magical piece of the chosen element from its elemental plane. The element can be used for any of its normal uses. For example, air can be breathed by an air-breathing creature, and fire casts light and can ignite flammable substances.<br>- Move : Move an existing piece of the element up to 20 feet in any direction. If you bring it into your space, you can catch it in an open hand. You can Sustain the impulse to keep moving the element.<br>- Suppress : You destroy an existing piece of element, such as snuffing out a flame or evaporating water from a cup. This affects only natural forms of the element, not durable, crafted goods like a stone statue, metal lock, or wooden door.;;;;;;;;;;The range increases by 15 feet, and the maximum Bulk increases by 1 (allowing Bulk 1 at 5th level).;;;;dimgray;portal
